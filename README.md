# Epicodus Unit 4.2: Object-Oriented JavaScript: Movie Tickets

#### Assignment Two of Object-Oriented JavaScript in unit 4.2, Start Date: 02/26/2019, Initial Finalization Date: 04/18/2019

#### By **Robert James "Jimmy" Gore**

## Description

The purpose of this project is to further demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming in an application that creates movie tickets based on a list of movies and other inputs generated by the user.  The application will first generate a list of movies predefined in the scripts, each with its own details such as ratings, times for showings, prices, and so on.  Upon selection of a movie, the form for creating a ticket will advance and create a list of times based on the selected movie as well as provide an input for the user to input their age.  Depending on the age input, the application will determine if the movie is safe for the buyer to view and then create a displayed ticket if the movie is deemed appropriate enough for the user to view, canceling creation of the ticket if the user's age is below the age recommendation.
